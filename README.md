# demographic-data-analyzer-freeCodeCamp
This is an exercise from the Data Analysis course of Free Code Camp.
Demographic Data Analyzer
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/demographic-data-analyzer

The idea is to answer some questions to do some practice.

Data origin: 1994 Census bureau database. 
From Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income
" A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1) && (HRSWK>0)). The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year"
